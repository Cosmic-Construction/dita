 <title>Metadata attributes</title>
  <shortdesc>The metadata attributes specify properties of the content that can be used to determine
    how the content is processed. Specialized metadata attributes can be defined to enable specific
    business-processing needs, such as semantic processing and data mining.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>Metadata attributes typically are used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Filtering content based on the attribute values, for example, to suppress or publish
        profiled content</li>
      <li>Flagging content based on the attribute values, for example, to highlight specific content
        on output</li>
      <li>Performing custom processing, for example, to extract business-critical data and store it
        in a database</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The base DITA vocabulary includes five specializations of the <xmlatt>props</xmlatt>
      attribute as domains: <xmlatt>audience</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>deliveryTarget</xmlatt>
      <xmlatt>platform</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>product</xmlatt>, and <xmlatt>otherprops</xmlatt>. These
      five attributes are included in all map and topic document-type shells provided with the
      specification.</p>
    <p>Metadata attributes fall into a few categories.</p>

        <dd>The <xmlatt>props</xmlatt> attribute and its specializations are intended for filtering.
          This includes the five specializations added to the OASIS document-type shells:
            <xmlatt>audience</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>deliveryTarget</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>platform</xmlatt>,
            <xmlatt>product</xmlatt>, and <xmlatt>otherprops</xmlatt>.</dd>

        <dd>The <xmlatt>class</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>DITAArchVersion</xmlatt>, and
            <xmlatt>specializations</xmlatt> attributes provide metadata about the DITA source
          itself, such as what version of the grammar is used. These attributes are not intended for
          use by authors.</dd>

        <dt>Other metadata attributes</dt>
        <dd>The <xmlatt>status</xmlatt> and <xmlatt>importance</xmlatt> attributes, as well as
          custom attributes specialized from <xmlatt>base</xmlatt>, are intended for
          application-specific behavior, such as identifying metadata to aid in search and
          retrieval.</dd>

  &lt;alt>The image is a workflow diagram showing a ticketing workflow.
       The initial status is "Open". From there, the ticket can move to
       "Closed" or "In progress". A ticket that is in progress can move
       to "Done" or "Blocked". A blocked ticket can move back to "In
       Progress" or directly to "Done". There are no steps beyond closed
       or done.</codeblock>

      <p>A couple of comments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This section does not include examples of simple tables and
          acccessibility. Do we need an example here? Can we simply point
          to the examples in the <xmlelement>simpletable</xmlelement>
          topic?</li>
        <li>The example topics about <xmlelement>table</xmlelement> were
          relocated from the element-reference
            <xmlelement>table</xmlelement> topic. They were reviewed as
          part of that content, but might need some slight tweak now that
          they are part of the "Accessibility" topic.</li>

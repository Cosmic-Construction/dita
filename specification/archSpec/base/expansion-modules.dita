  <title>Expansion modules</title>
  <shortdesc>Expansion modules enable the extension of content models and
    attribute lists for individual elements. Expansion modules are the
    opposite of constraints. They add elements and attributes to specific
    content models and attribute lists, rather than removing
    them.</shortdesc>

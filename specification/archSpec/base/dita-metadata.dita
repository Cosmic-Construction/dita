 <title>DITA metadata</title>
  <abstract>
    <shortdesc>Metadata can be applied in both DITA topics and DITA maps.
      Metadata that is assigned in DITA topics can be supplemented or
      overridden by metadata that is assigned in a DITA map; this design
      facilitates the reuse of DITA topics in different DITA maps and
      use-specific contexts.</shortdesc>

      <p>From TC call on 25 January 2022: Consider whether we might (or
        might not) make a statement that all rendering and most processing
        for metadata is by necessity implementation-specific.</p>

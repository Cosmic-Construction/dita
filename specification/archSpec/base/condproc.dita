      <p>The following content was in the container topic for the DITAVAL
        elements. I think it should be edited, rephrased as a normative
        statement, and covered here:</p>
      <p>Conditional processing code should provide a report of any
        attribute values encountered in content that do not have an action
        associated with them.</p>

        <draft-comment author="rodaande" time="21 March 2022">I'm less
      convinced it needs to be a normative statement. I think it can be a
      helpful addition to a processor, but it can also be a big annoyance.
      If anything about it is normative, I think it needs to be MAY,
      allowing processors to choose whether such notification is
      appropriate for their use cases.</draft-comment>
    <draft-comment author="Kristen J Eberlein" time="21 March 2022">
      <p>Maybe we should have a topic here in the architectural section
        about errors? We could move some of the normative statements about
        errors from the element-reference topics to here.</p>

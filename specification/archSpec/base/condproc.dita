      <p>The following content was in the container topic for the DITAVAL
        elements. I think it should be edited, rephrased as a normative
        statement, and covered here:</p>
      <p>Conditional processing code should provide a report of any
        attribute values encountered in content that do not have an action
        associated with them.</p>

        <draft-comment author="rodaande" time="28 March 2022">I'm less convinced it needs to be a
            normative statement. I think it can be a helpful addition to a processor, but it can
            also be a big annoyance. If anything about it is normative, I think it needs to be MAY,
            allowing processors to choose whether such notification is appropriate for their use
            cases.</draft-comment>

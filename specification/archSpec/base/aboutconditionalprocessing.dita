        <dd>A process that determines whether content is included,
          excluded, or flagged. This process is based on a comparison of

            >I'm not certain "conditional processing profile" warrants a
            separate definition. I added it after going through some of the
            following topics, and seeing a distinctions between a DITAVAL
            document and a [set of conditions sent as input to a processor]
            â€“ for example, DITA-OT or an editor can apply conditions from
            multiple DITAVAL documents as a single conditional processing
            profile.</draft-comment></dd>

        <dt>DITAVAL document</dt>
        <dd>A document that specifies a set of rules that define which elements to include, exclude,
          or flag. A DITAVAL document can be a file on the file system, a set of rules stored in
          memory, or another way of storing information that is expressed using DITAVAL
            syntax.<!--<draft-comment author="rodaande" audience="spec-editors" time="18 March 2022">Do we need to / should we state here that this can be a file on the file system, a set of rules in memory, or any other way of storing filtering information that can be expressed using DITAVAL syntax?</draft-comment>--><draft-comment

            <p>Do we need to explicitly mention passthrough in the first sentence, or is passthrough
              considered to be part of flagging? If the latter, we should explicitly state that in
              the topic where we give a high-level overview of the sort of rules that can be defined
              using a DITAVAL document.</p>
          </draft-comment><draft-comment author="rodaande" time="25 March 2022">I think it could be
            considered a form of flagging. Given that I expect usage is low, and it is so nebulous
            ("do this and something might happen, if your rendering format enables it"), I don't
            think it deserves a whole topic on its own. Could we broaden the definition of flagging
            to say that it also encompasses the "passthrough" value, and then extend the "Flagging"
            topic to cover both?</draft-comment></dd>

    </draft-comment>
    <draft-comment author="rodaande" time="25 March 2022">I'm wary of trying to pin down a broad
      term like "including", but I don't really know. The assumption of the spec, and I assumed of
      spec readers, was that the DITA content is rendered in some way (in an editor, as HTML, as
      PDF, etc), and that by default the DITA content is meant for publishing. For that reason, we
      go out of our way to say *not* to render data elements and foreign elements, but we don't do
      the reverse for paragraphs, tables, etc.<p>I'm not sure though, beause "include" is clearly a
        value you can specity in DITAVAL.</p></draft-comment>

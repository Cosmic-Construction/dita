        <dd>A process that determines whether content is included,
          excluded, or flagged. This process is based on a comparison of
          conditional-processing attributes in the DITA source with the
          rules that are set in one or more DITAVAL documents.</dd>

            >I'm not certain "conditional processing profile" warrants a
            separate definition. I added it after going through some of the
            following topics, and seeing a distinctions between a DITAVAL
            document and a [set of conditions sent as input to a processor]
            â€“ for example, DITA-OT or an editor can apply conditions from
            multiple DITAVAL documents as a single conditional processing
            profile.</draft-comment></dd>

        <dd>A document that specifies a set of rules that define which
          elements to include, exclude, or flag. A DITAVAL document can be
          a file on the file system, a set of rules stored in memory, or
          another way of storing information that is expressed using
          DITAVAL
            syntax.<!--<draft-comment author="rodaande" audience="spec-editors" time="18 March 2022">Do we need to / should we state here that this can be a file on the file system, a set of rules in memory, or any other way of storing filtering information that can be expressed using DITAVAL syntax?</draft-comment>--><draft-comment

      <p>The following content is not about core concepts, It is about the
        following and should be relocated elsewhere:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What we expect from processors</li>
        <li>The fact that the spec does not define mechanisms for
          conditional processing using metadata elements</li>
      </ul>

        <p>Processors <term outputclass="RFC-2119">SHOULD</term> be able to perform filtering and
            flagging using the following attributes: <xmlatt>props</xmlatt>,
                <xmlatt>audience</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>deliveryTarget</xmlatt>,
                <xmlatt>platform</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>product</xmlatt>, and
            <xmlatt>otherprops</xmlatt>.</p>
        <p>The <xmlatt>props</xmlatt> attribute can be specialized to create new attributes, and
            processors <term outputclass="RFC-2119">SHOULD</term> be able to perform conditional
            processing on specializations of <xmlatt>props</xmlatt>.</p>
        <p>Although metadata elements exist with similar names, such as the
                <xmlelement>audience</xmlelement> element, the specification does not define any
            mechanism for conditional processing using metadata elements.</p>

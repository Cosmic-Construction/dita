    <title>Map-to-map cascading behaviors</title>
    <shortdesc>When a DITA map or <ph rev="review-k">map branch</ph> is
    referenced by another DITA map, by default certain rules apply. These
    rules pertain to the cascading behaviors of attributes, metadata
    elements, and <ph rev="review-k">the</ph> roles <ph rev="review-k">that
      are</ph> assigned to content <ph rev="review-k">For</ph> example, the
    role of "Chapter" <ph rev="review-k">that is</ph> assigned by a
      <xmlelement>chapter</xmlelement> element. Attributes and elements
    that cascade within a map generally follow the same rules when
    cascading from one map to another map, but there are some exceptions
    and additional rules that apply.</shortdesc>

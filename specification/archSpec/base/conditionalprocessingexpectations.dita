    <title>Expectations for conditional processing</title>
    <shortdesc>Certain behaviors are expected of processors when working with conditional
        processing.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Processors <term outputclass="RFC-2119">SHOULD</term> be able to perform filtering and
            flagging using the following attributes: <xmlatt>props</xmlatt>,
                <xmlatt>audience</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>deliveryTarget</xmlatt>,
                <xmlatt>platform</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>product</xmlatt>, and
            <xmlatt>otherprops</xmlatt>.</p>
        <p>The <xmlatt>props</xmlatt> attribute can be specialized to create new attributes, and
            processors <term outputclass="RFC-2119">SHOULD</term> be able to perform conditional
            processing on specializations of <xmlatt>props</xmlatt>.</p>
        <p>Although metadata elements exist with similar names, such as the
                <xmlelement>audience</xmlelement> element, the specification does not define any
            mechanism for conditional processing using metadata elements.</p>

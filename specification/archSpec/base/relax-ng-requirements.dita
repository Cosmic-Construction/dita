 <title>RELAX NG coding requirements</title>
 <shortdesc>This section explains how to implement RNG based document-type shells, specializations,
  and <ph rev="2.0">element-configuration modules (constraints and expansions).</ph></shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>If you plan to generate DTD- or XSD-based modules from RELAX NG
      modules, avoid RELAX NG features that cannot be translated into DTD
      or XSD constructs. When RELAX NG is used directly for DITA document
      validation, the document-type shells for those documents can
      integrate constraint modules that use the full power of RELAX NG to
      enforce constraints that cannot be enforced by DTDs or XSDs.</p>

      <p>This is OASIS boiler plate. Ideally, we'd include information here
        about the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visual formatting of the normative statements</li>
        <li>Appendix of aggregated  normative statements</li>
        <li>Maybe verbiage about how we use normative statements: focus on
          interoperability and NOT using them for things that are enforced
          by the grammar files</li>
      </ul>

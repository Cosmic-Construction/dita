    <p>The DITA specification uses <xmlelement>keyword</xmlelement>
      elements with the <xmlatt>outputclass</xmlatt> attribute set to
        <keyword>RFC-2119</keyword> for these key words. In general,
      normative statements that use such key words pertain to what is
      needed for interoperability.</p>
    <!--<draft-comment author="Kristen J Eberlein" time="21 April 2022"><p>This is OASIS boiler plate. Ideally, we'd include information here about the following:</p><ul><li>Visual formatting of the normative statements</li><li>Appendix of aggregated normative statements</li><li>Maybe verbiage about how we use normative statements: focus on interoperability and NOT using them for things that are enforced by the grammar files</li></ul></draft-comment>-->
    <div platform="dita-tc-publishing">
      <p>These key words are rendered with bold formatting. These normative
        statements are indicated visually in the rendered specification by
        blue lines at the left and right of the statement:</p>
      <image placement="break" href="../images/rfc-2119-statement.png"
        scale="80"/>
      <p>In addition, a hyperlink is rendered to the left of the statement
        that contains the normative term. The link is to a generated
        appendix that groups all the normative statements that appear in
        the specification.</p>

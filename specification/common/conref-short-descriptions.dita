 <title>Short descriptions reused with LwDITA</title>
 <!-- KJE: Ensure that the shortdesc are ordered alphabetically by element name. Use the element name as the value of the @id attribute. -->
 <abstract>
  <shortdesc id="alt">Alternate text is a textual description of an image that can be read
   or displayed in place of the image. This is commonly used to create text alternatives for readers
   or systems that cannot view the original image.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="b">Bold text is used to draw a reader's attention to a phrase without
   otherwise adding meaning to the content.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="body">The body contains the main content of a topic.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="data">Data is a generic component that represents metadata within a DITA topic or
   map. Complex metadata is represented by nested data structures.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="dd">The definition description provides the definition for a term in a definition
   list entry. </shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="desc">A description is a statement that describes or contains additional
   information about an object.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="dl">A definition list is a list of terms and corresponding definitions.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="dlentry">A definition list entry groups a term and its definition.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="dt">A definition term is the text that is defined in a definition list
   entry.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="fig">A figure is a container for a variety of objects, including artwork, images,
   code samples, equations, and tables.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="fn">The <xmlelement>fn</xmlelement> element specifies content for an ancillary note
   placed in the footer of a page or at the end of an online article. Such content is usually
   inappropriate for inline inclusion. The <xmlelement>fn</xmlelement> element also is used to
   indicate the source for facts or other material cited in the text. </shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="i"> Italic text is a way to emphasize the key points in printed text, or when
   quoting a speaker, a way to show which words the speaker stressed.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="image">An image is a reference to artwork that is stored outside of the content. </shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="keydef"><draft-comment author="robander">Need to take care when converting this to
    use natural language; our definition of the "key definition" as an element has to be distinct
    from our concept of a "key defintion" in the DITA architecture.</draft-comment>The
    <xmlelement>keydef</xmlelement> element is a convenience element that is used to define keys
   without any of the other effects that occur when using a <xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement>
   element: no content is included in output, no title is included in the table of contents, and no
   linking or other relationships are defined. The <xmlelement>keydef</xmlelement> element is not
   the only way to define keys; its purpose is to simplify the process by defaulting several
   attributes to achieve the described behaviors.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="li">A list item is an item in either an ordered or unordered list.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="linktext">Link text is the label for a link or resource.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="map">The <xmlelement>map</xmlelement> element describes the relationships among a
   set of resources, such as DITA topics. Maps consist of references to topics, maps, and other
   resources organized into hierarchies, groups, and tables. Maps express these relationships in a
   single common format that can be used for different outputs. <draft-comment

   </draft-comment></shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="navtitle">A navigation title provides a title for a resource. When used in topics,
   it is an alternate title that is designed for situations when the topic title is unsuitable for
   use in a table of contents or navigation pane.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="note">A note contains information that expands on or calls attention to a
   particular point.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="ol">An ordered list is a list of items that are sorted by sequence or order of
   importance.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="p"> A paragraph is a single unit of text that contain a main idea.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="ph">The <xmlelement>ph</xmlelement> element is used to enclose a phrase for reuse or
   conditional processing (for example, when part of a paragraph applies to a particular audience).
   It can be used by specializations of DITA to create semantic markup for content at the phrase
   level, which then allows (but does not require) specific processing or formatting.</shortdesc>
  <shortdesc id="pre">Preformatted text is text that contains line breaks and spaces that are
   intended to be preserved at publication time.</shortdesc>

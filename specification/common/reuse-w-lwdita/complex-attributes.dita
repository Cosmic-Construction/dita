    <title>Complex attributes</title>
    <shortdesc>This is a temporary topic used to group topics about complex
    attributes that are in both DITA 2.0 and LwDITA. These topics appeared
    in the "Language reference" in the DITA 1.x spec, but are integrated
    into the "Architectural" section of the spec for DITA 2.0. It's unclear
    how this content will be handled in the LwDITA spec; do we just refer
    readers to "See that DITA 2.0 specification"? Only a handful of these
    topics have been edited and reviewed for DITA 2.0:
      <xmlatt>format</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>href</xmlatt>, and
      <xmlatt>scope</xmlatt>.</shortdesc>

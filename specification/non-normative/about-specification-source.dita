 <title>About the specification source</title>
 <shortdesc>The DITA specification is authored in DITA. It is a complex document that uses many DITA
  features, including key references (keyrefs), content references (conrefs), and controlled values
  set in a subject scheme map.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The source files for the DITA specification are managed in a GitHub repository that is
   maintained by OASIS; they also can be downloaded from OASIS.</p>
  <p >The DITA Technical Committee used the following applications to work
   with the DITA source:</p>
  <ul >
      <li>Antenna House Formatter</li>
   <li>DITA Open Toolkit</li>
      <li>DITAweb</li>
   <li>&lt;oXygen/> XML Editor and XMetaL Author Enterprise</li>
  </ul>

      <p>Congility rebranded DITAweb as Congility Content Server a while
        back. I don't know if what we are using is an old instance of
        DITAweb or a version of Congility Content Server. They no longer
        sell the product as a review tool. We need to ask them how they
        want us to refer to their product in this topic.</p>

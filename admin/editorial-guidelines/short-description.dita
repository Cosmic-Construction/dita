    <title>Short description</title>
    <shortdesc>Use the short description to provide a description of "what
    something is". Use natural language, unless doing so would be
    incredibly awkward.</shortdesc>

      <title>Tips for writing good short descriptions</title>
      <p>For help on phrasing a natural language short description, perform
        a web search on the question "What is a <varname>thing</varname>?".
        Often the search will provide a common definition very quickly.</p>
      <p>To check that the short descriptions for a cluster of topics are
        parallel, generate HTML5 output and look at the link previews. For
        example:</p>
      <image placement="break" href="images/link-previews-shortdesc.jpg"
        scale="70"/>

      <title>Examples of natural-language short descriptions</title>
      <p>Consider the following short descriptions for the
          <xmlelement>steps</xmlelement> and <xmlelement>cmd</xmlelement>
        elements:</p>
      <lq>Steps are a series of actions that people perform in a specific
        order and manner.</lq>
      <lq>A command specifies the action that people take to complete a
        step.</lq>
    </example>

      <title>Examples of short description that do not use natural
        language</title>
      <p>Consider the following short descriptions for the
          <xmlelement>chhead</xmlelement> and
          <xmlelement>choices</xmlelement> elements:</p>
      <lq>The <xmlelement>chhead</xmlelement> element contains <ph
          rev="review-a">elements that provide labels</ph> for <ph
          rev="review-a">the columns in</ph> a choice table.</lq>
      <lq>The <xmlelement>choices</xmlelement> element contains a list of
        choices. Each choice represents a way <ph rev="review-a">to</ph>
        complete the current step.</lq>

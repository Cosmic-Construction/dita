    <title>Example</title>
    <shortdesc>This section should be titled either "Example" or
    "Examples," depending on how many examples the section
    contains.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
    <p>Consider the following guidelines for making the "Example" sections
      consistent across the specification</p>
    <section>
      <title>Markup</title>
      <p>The <xmlelement>example</xmlelement> element should specify the
          <xmlatt>id</xmlatt> and <xmlatt>otherprops</xmlatt> attributes.
        Ensure that the following markup is used:</p>
      <codeblock>&lt;example id="example" otherprops="examples></codeblock>
      <p>This markup ensures the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>People can target the "Examples" section. The section might be
          a target of a cross reference by spec editors, or it might be a
          target of a conref push operation performed by companies that use
          the DITA spec source as part of their company-specific style
          guide.</li>
        <li>Implementers that want to publish the spec for their own
          purposes can choose to exclude non-normative content .</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title><b>Introductory paragraphs and punctuation</b></title>
      <p>Each code sample should be preceded by an explanatory paragraph
        that describes what the example illustrates. Use the following
        pattern: "The following code sample shows how X can be used to Y:"
        If the intro paragraph contains a single sentence, it should end
        with a colon. If the intro paragraph contains more than one
        sentence, end it with a period.</p>
      <p><b>Examples:</b><image placement="break"
          href="images/example-intro-sentence.jpg" scale="60"/><image
          placement="break" href="images/example-two-intro-sentences.jpg"
          scale="90"/></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Code sample indentation and highlighting</title>
      <p>The code sample should be indented two spaces. Use bold
        highlighting to call attention to the opening and closing tags. If
        an example is displayed on a single line, highlight the element and
        its contents.</p>
      <p><b>Examples:</b><image placement="break"
          href="images/example-highlighting-tags.jpg" scale="90"/><image
          placement="break"
          href="images/example-highlighting-entire-tags.jpg" scale="90"
        /></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Using ellipses to "snip" some of the code</title>
      <p>Code samples should be valid XML that can be copied-and-pasted
        into an editor (in the proper context). If ellipses are used to
        indicate missing information, surround them in an XML comment. For
        example: </p>
      <image placement="break" href="images/examples-ellipses.jpg"
        scale="90"/>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Multiple examples</title>
      <p>Begin with a paragraph that states "This section contains examples
        of how the <xmlelement>x</xmlelement> element can be used. Surround
        each introductory paragraph and code sample with a
          <xmlelement>figure</xmlelement> element that has a descriptive
        title. For example:</p>
      <image placement="break" href="images/examples-multiple-examples.jpg"
      />
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Cross referencing to another topic</title>
      <p>(For elements that are part of a larger structure, such as a table
        or definition list entry) Instead of containing an example, the
        section can have a cross reference to another topic. Use the
        following type of markup, where the key reference targets the
        "Example" section of the other target.</p>
      <codeblock>&lt;p>See 
  &lt;xref keyref="elements-table/example">&lt;xmlelement>table&lt;/xmlelement>&lt;/xref>.
&lt;/p></codeblock>
      <p>This markup will be rendered in the following way:<image
          placement="break"
          href="images/examples-cross-reference-to-other-topic.jpg"
          scale="90"/></p>
      <p>If you need to link to a specific figure within an "Example"
        section, be sure to modify the target of the key reference so that
        you are linking to the specific figure.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Showing rendering of the code sample</title>
      <p>For examples where you want to show possible rendering, use a
        screen capture with good alternate text. Do not just include
        markup, leaving the rendering up to whatever stylesheets are used
        when the output is generated. (Remember that the DITA specification
        often is republished by other businesses and organizations who use
        their own stylesheets.)</p>
      <p>Both the dita and dita-techcom repositories have an associated
        Word document that can be used to mock up rendered output.  This
        document is named <filepath>screen-captures.docx</filepath>, and it
        located in the  <filepath>specification/resources</filepath>
        directories.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Content of code samples</title>
      <p>Do your best to replace "faked" examples with content that would
        conceivably be production content.</p>
